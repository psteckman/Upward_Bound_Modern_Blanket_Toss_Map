This repository is for mapping the Upward Bound Communities and highlighting the particular communities that will be participating in the Modern Blanket Toss.

The map that will be seen received its data sources from [ASGDC](http://www.asgdc.state.ak.us) and [GINA](http://www.gina.alaska.edu).

The two funders of this project are [Upward Bound](http://ub.community.uaf.edu) and [EPSCOR](http://www.alaska.edu/epscor/).
